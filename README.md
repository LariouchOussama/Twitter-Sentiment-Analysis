# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for performing sentiment analysis on Twitter data using state-of-the-art natural language processing models, including BERT, LSTM, and GPT. The notebook covers the entire pipeline, from data preprocessing and exploration to model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.

## Overview

- **Data Preprocessing:** The notebook preprocesses Twitter data by cleaning and transforming text, removing noise, and preparing it for analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizations are provided to understand the distribution of sentiments in the dataset.

- **Modeling:** Three powerful models—BERT, LSTM, and GPT—are implemented for sentiment classification. The notebook utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library for BERT and GPT.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The models are trained on the dataset, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representations of confusion matrices are included for a detailed understanding of model performance.
